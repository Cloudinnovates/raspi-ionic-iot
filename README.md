# Synopsis
A simple IOT project using the Ionic Framework to create a simple app that turns on an LED on a breadboard connected to Raspberry Pi.

# Motivation
I decided to create this project after I learnt about how to use Node,js to interact with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.  I also decided to build a simple mobile app using the Ionic Framework to interact with the Raspberry Pi via a simple API call.

#Installation
For anyone who has never played around with a Raspberry Pi here's a great <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/quick-start-guide-v2_1.pdf" target="_blank">quick start guide</a> from the official <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">raspberrypi.org</a> website.
The project assumes that you have a Raspberry Pi (any of the models) and are able to run it 'headless' (with no keyboard or display).  
Here is a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=74176" target="_blank">tutorial on how to setup the Raspberry Pi 'headless'</a>.
You will need to have Node.js installed on your Raspberry Pi   

**The video below shows how the app interacts with the Raspberry Pi.**
