# Synopsis
A simple IOT project using the Ionic Framework to create a simple app that turns on an LED on a breadboard connected to Raspberry Pi.

# Motivation
I decided to create this project after I learnt about how to use Node,js to interact with the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.  I also decided to build a simple mobile app using the Ionic Framework to interact with the Raspberry Pi via a simple API call.

**The video below shows how the app interacts with the Raspberry Pi.**
